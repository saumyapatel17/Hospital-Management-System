# Hospital-Management-System
The project on “Hospital Management System” has been given to us as a part of the Course project in Object oriented programming(CS1101) in the Second Semester. We have tried our best to make the complicated process of Hospital Management System as simple as possible using Structured &amp; Modular technique &amp; Menu oriented interface.  The project is based on the database object oriented and networking techniques as there are many areas where we keep the records in a database for which we are using MYSQL software which is one of the best and the easiest  software to keep our information . This project uses JAVA as the front end software which is an object oriented programming language and has connectivity with MySQL.
